# 13.  Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`,  `V`,  `X`,  `L`,  `C`,  `D`  and  `M`.

    -------     -------
    Symbol       Value
    -------     -------
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000

For example, two is written as  `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as,  `XII`, which is simply  `X`  +  `II`. The number twenty seven is written as  `XXVII`, which is  `XX`  +  `V`  +  `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not  `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as  `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as  `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

-   `I`  can be placed before  `V`  (5) and  `X`  (10) to make 4 and 9.
-   `X`  can be placed before  `L`  (50) and  `C`  (100) to make 40 and 90.
-   `C`  can be placed before  `D`  (500) and  `M`  (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Method Definition:

    class Solution {
        public int romanToInt(String s) {
            
        }
    }


Example 1:

    Input:"III"
    Output: 3

Example 2:

    Input: "IV"
    Output: 4

Example 3:

    Input: "IX"
    Output: 9

Example 4:

    Input: "LVIII"
    Output: 58
    Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 5:

    Input: "MCMXCIV"
    Output: 1994
    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

# Solution
## One pass
**Logical Thought**  
We use NUMBER_DICTIONARY to avoid too many if's. The static initialiser will be executed before the constructor. This will make the solution run faster for any new test case. The logic is simple. We subtract curInt from sum only if curInt < nextInt, or else, we add curInt to sum. We're using the character difference from `A` as the index in the static array.

```
class Solution 
{
     private final static int[] NUMBER_DICTIONARY = new int[26];
    
    static {
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['I' - 'A'] = 1;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['V' - 'A'] = 5;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['X' - 'A'] = 10;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['L' - 'A'] = 50;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['C' - 'A'] = 100;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['D' - 'A'] = 500;
        NUMBER_DICTIONARY['M' - 'A'] = 1000;
    }
    
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        char[] array = s.toCharArray();
        int sum = 0, curInt = 0, nextInt = NUMBER_DICTIONARY[s.charAt(0) - 'A'];
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
            curInt = nextInt;
            nextInt = NUMBER_DICTIONARY[array[i + 1] - 'A'];
            if (curInt < nextInt) {
                sum -= curInt;
                continue;
            }
            sum += curInt;
        }
        sum += nextInt;
        return sum;
    }
}
```
