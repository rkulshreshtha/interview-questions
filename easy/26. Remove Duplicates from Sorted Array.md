# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


Given a sorted array  _nums_, remove the duplicates  [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)  such that each element appear only  _once_  and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by  **modifying the input array  [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)**  with O(1) extra memory.

Method Definition:

    class Solution {
        public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
            
        }
    }

Example 1:

    Given nums = [1,1,2],
    
    Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    
    It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

    Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
    
    Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    
    It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

    // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
    int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
    
    // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
    // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        print(nums[i]);
    }

# Solution
## Iterative solution with slow and fast pointer
The approach is to maintain two pointers, one for the current index which needs to be updated with next non duplicate number and the second one to keep moving and find the index of next non duplicate number.
```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        //The current index
        int currentIndex = 0;
        //The index of next non duplicate number
        int nonDuplicateIndex = 1;
		
        /*
            Iterate the sorted array till you encounter a non duplicate on nonDuplicateIndex
            Once found nonDuplicateIndex, update the value at currentIndex to that non duplicate value
            Increment the currentIndex
        */
        
        while(nonDuplicateIndex < nums.length) {
            if(nums[currentIndex] < nums[nonDuplicateIndex]) {
                nums[currentIndex+1] = nums[nonDuplicateIndex];
                currentIndex++;
            }
            nonDuplicateIndex++;
        }
		
        /*
            Since currentIndex is 0 indexed, total count at the end will be currentIndex + 1
            In the end we'll still be returning the same length array
            [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] will be modified to [0,1,2,3,4,2,2,3,3,4]
            with returning count = 3 (currentIndex) + 1
        */
        return currentIndex+1;
    }
}
```
