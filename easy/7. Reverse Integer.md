# 7. Reverse Integer


Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Method Definition:

     class Solution {
        public int reverse(int x) {   
        }
    }


Example 1:  

    Input: 123
     Output: 321

Example 2:  

    Input: -123 
    Output: -321 

Example 3:  

    Input: 120 
    Output: 21 

**Note**: 
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

# Solution
## One pass
```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int factor = 1, result = 0;
        if(x < 0) {
            factor = -1;
            x = x * -1;
        }
        while(x > 0) {
            result = result*10 + x%10;
            x = x/10;
            // if you still have more digits left and your current number is > max_value/10 you'd run into overflow
            if(result > Integer.MAX_VALUE/10 && x > 0) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return result * factor;
    }
}
```
TC : O(n) where n represents the number of digits in integer
SC : O(1)
