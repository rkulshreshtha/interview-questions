# 9.  Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Method Definition:

 

      class Solution {
        public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
            
       }


Example 1:  

    Input: 121
    Output: true

Example 2:  

    Input: -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:  

    Input: 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

# Solution
## One pass
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return false; // if negative number return false
        int copy = x, rev = 0; // rev is the reverse to be found
        while (copy > 0) {
            rev = (rev * 10) + (copy % 10); // Reverse the number
            copy /= 10;
        }
        
        return rev == x;
    }
}
